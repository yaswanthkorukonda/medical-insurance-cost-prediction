# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction: A Random Forest Regressor Model

This project aims to develop a web application that predicts insurance costs based on various demographic and health-related factors. We've built a machine learning model using Random Forest and integrated it into a Flask web application.

## Features 🎯

- Predict insurance costs based on user input
- User-friendly web interface for data entry
- Real-time predictions using a trained Random Forest model
- Visualizations of key insights from the dataset

## Technologies Used 💻

- Flask: Web framework for building the application
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: Numerical computing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization
- Jinja2: Template engine for HTML rendering

## Setup Instructions 🛠️

1. Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/yaswanthkorukonda/medical-insurance-cost-prediction.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd insurance-prediction-app`

3. Install required dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the Flask application:
`python app.py`
5. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

## Usage 🛝

1. Navigate to the root URL (`/`) to access the main page.
2. Fill out the form with your demographic information (age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region).
3. Click "Predict" to get your estimated insurance costs.
